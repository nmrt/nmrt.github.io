title: California, here I come! :D
---
So, here it finally happened. After 10 years of dreaming and working hard to
achieve my dreams, it has been done. I am at Google HQ in California! Never
too late. And not as a tourist either, but as part of the team.

![The team][team]

From left to right: Alex (team leader), Ruohan (frontend) and me (universal
soldier). That's not the whole team, although it's not big: around 10 members
(still not sure if I've met everyone). Hopefully, someday I'll be able to make
a picture of us all.

![Alex and me][alex-me]

Here are Alex and me after fitness in front of the main building. It was on
the eve of [PRIDE festival][pride], hence the rainbows in "o" letters.

![Before fitness][fitness]

BTW, I was enthralled with difficulty of exercises. It's not meant for
*girls*! As you can see, most of us are guys, but there are some tough gals.

![Nap pod][pod]

One of my favorite non-technical sides of Google: they dig power naps. :wink:
The *low tech* device to help you do just that is called nap pod (low tech
because its *door* doesn't auto closes). Well, good enough for me: it has
built-in timer, music and even massages your back before waking you up!

![The ocean][ocean]

For now, I didn't have a lot of free time. So, just one visit to the ocean. It
was cloudy this time. Also, you'd be surprised how chilling it was, both
outside and even more so inside the water. But that's exactly how we, Vikings,
like it! :smiling_imp: Next time will try to conquer some waves on surfing
board.

That's it for the time being. Will try to post regularly here and maybe on
Twitter, Facebook etc.

P.S. This was [the tune][tune] that I was listening to when I was 18, or so,
and thinking about how it would be to come to California... :notes: Hearing it
again has influenced the title of this post.
